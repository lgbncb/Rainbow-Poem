The Colors of the Rainbow After the Rain

A rainbow shines after the rain,
Colors are dancing once again.
Bright and gentle in the sky,
A happy bridge from way up high.

It stretches wide from end to end,
A quiet sign the storms will mend.
Soft and bright above the ground,
A happy bridge that’s newly found.

It softly fades but leaves a glow,
A gentle peace, the sky will show.
A promise painted in each hue,
A happy bridge that feels brand new.

When sunlight meets the drops that fall,
A magic moment comes to call.
A fleeting gift the skies create,
A happy bridge we celebrate.
