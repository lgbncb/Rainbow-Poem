The Colors of the Rainbow After the Rain

A rainbow shines after the rain,
Colors are dancing once again.
Bright and gentle in the sky,
A happy bridge from way up high.

It stretches wide from end to end,
A quiet sign the storms will mend.
Soft and bright above the ground,
A happy bridge that’s newly found.
